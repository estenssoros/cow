# Cow

All inspiration (and code) drawn from https://github.com/gobuffalo. My goal was to simplify the process for working with a golang-react-typescript application allowing users to create their database schemas, migrations, and middlewares.

As of today, I have no tests, contributors, or stars.

My philosophy is that open-source packages shouldn't just be plugged in when unnecessary. Reappropriate sources code to meet your own needs and build great software.

We stand on the shoulders of giants.

There is a lot to do. including but not limited to

- init - create everything you need for a react-typescript application)
- ensure - ensure build dependencies (this one should be straightforward)
- write tests - so so many tests
- review my code (i dunno I've been writing go for a year?)
